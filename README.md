## Game goal

It's a 1v1 game, where you can choose to compete with a friend or a robot.

You and your enemy each have a shop, and customers start appearing — slowly `for shure` at the beginning, but the longer the game goes on, the faster they will come, requiring you to craft cakes more and more quickly.

The game has a high score feature, allowing players to compete even without playing at the same time, by trying to get the best scores.
